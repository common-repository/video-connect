= Greet Users with Floating Video Bubble =

Place a floating video bubble on every page of your website to increase trust. A personal video introduction can significantly increase your conversions and sales because people trust people more than Text!

= Video Widgets to Explain Your Products or Services =

Use Video widgets to speak to your your website users. A good copywriting is not always sufficient. Now you can simply explain to your customers about your products and services using your own video to generate trust and increase conversion rates. Show the video widget button anywhere on your page with <strong>shortcode</strong>. When it is clicked, the video will play on the bottom right corner. <strong>Youtube videos</strong> are supported. Both landscape and portrait mode are supported.

Video Widgets work on any page where you can place a shortcode.

= Featured Video for WooCommerce Products =

A product featured video plugin for WooCommerce that allows your customers to see a YouTube or Daily Motion video (Vimeo and self hosted videos supported in the pro version) instead of the featured image on the product single page.

Add the URL of a YouTube or Daily Motion video in the specific field on the woocommerce product edit page and your customers will be able to watch something dynamic and customized instead of a static image. This is a great way to increase your sales. Easy to use Featured Product video for your Woocommerce.
